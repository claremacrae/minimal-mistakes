* You can [apply for a scholarship](https://richardchandler590561.typeform.com/to/ruUqBs)

## Who are we?

`#include <C++>` is a global, inclusive, and diverse community for developers interested in C++. Here, you can find a welcoming space to learn and discuss C++. We also provide resources to create safer, more inclusive, community gatherings.

We believe that a community is only as good as how it treats its most vulnerable members. Therefore, we strive to create a welcoming, safe, and accessible environment. We have a strong [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct), which we [enforce](/moderation).

Our primary communication platform is our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZPErMGW). Join us to discuss and learn C++ in a welcoming, inclusive space.

The moderation and administration team includes [Patricia Aas](https://twitter.com/pati_gallardo), [Sy Brand](https://twitter.com/TartanLlama), [Noam Chitayat](https://twitter.com/_Noam), [Guy Davidson](https://twitter.com/hatcat01), [Timur Doumler](https://twitter.com/timur_audio), [Kate Gregory](https://twitter.com/gregcons), [Adi Shavit](https://twitter.com/AdiShavit), [Fred Tingaud](https://twitter.com/FredTingaudDev), [Bryce Lelbach](https://twitter.com/blelbach).
