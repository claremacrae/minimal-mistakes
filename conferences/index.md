# Conferences and Events

## For conference attendees

- We have a [friendly presence at conferences](/conferences/attending-conferences).
- We offer help for minorities and junior programmers to [attend major conferences](/conferences/scholarships). You can apply for scholarships, and donate to them.

## For conference organisers

- Help for conferences in reaching minority groups with calls for papers, and suggesting candidates to invite to speak and <a class="page-link" href="/conferences/organising-conferences/">running an inclusive conference</a>.
- A [toolbox](https://github.com/include-cpp/toolboxes) for C++ conferences to improve diversity and inclusion.
