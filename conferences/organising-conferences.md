# Organising Conferences

Many members of `#include <C++>` organise conferences themselves, or advise those who do. We have plenty of great suggestions about how to run an inclusive and welcoming conference.

For example, CppCon and C++ on Sea have demonstrated the value of many of these considerations in recent years:

* An enforced Code of Conduct
* Mechanisms for people to attend free, or at low cost, including volunteer programs, student programs, and supporting [our Scholarships](/conferences/scholarships)
* Thoughtful badge design
* Quiet rooms
* Accessible venue
* Captioning (in larger rooms, for larger conferences)
* Gender-neutral bathrooms
* Child care

<!--

* A variety of formats: keynotes and breakouts, but also panels, lightning talks, receptions, parties, games and quizzes, exhibition hall, poster presentations, podcasts being recorded on site with a live audience, silly things like powerpoint karaoke, tours and field trips, workshops, open sessions in soft spaces like couches and coffee tables instead of conference rooms
* Content on nontechnical yet related material like "how do you learn these things?" Or "how can I become a trainer/speaker/writer on this topic?" On relevant management issues, people issues, etc.
* A location that is safe and welcoming. If I am at a session in the evening, am I ok as a woman walking alone back to the hotel? What about in the daytime? Also, there should be restaurants and grocery stores within easy walking distance of the venues and the conference hotels. Popping out to buy some food for my room (or continuing a conversation with some other people over dinner) should be easy and natural and not require renting a car or taking cabs. Information about the local transit system (can I take a subway from the airport?) and local attractions should be on the website or in a "welcome, attendees" email.
